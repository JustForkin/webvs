## Development

Webvs uses grunt for build and npm for dependencies. Run the following commands to install all the Node modules.

	npm install

To build the code, run `grunt` or `grunt dist`. This generates `webvs.js` and or `webvs.min.js`  in the `build` directory or the minified files in the `dist` directory.

To run the tests, use `grunt test` command. To debug the code/examples, run `grunt debug`. This runs a webserver at 8000 and a live re-build of the source files.
To debug tests, run `grunt debug_test`. This is same as `grunt debug` but also runs karma test server and opens up the test page where you can do debugging with
the browser code inspector.
